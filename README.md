# Automatic Checker
Automatic checker is a python program that checks if a set of questionnares is correct and collects the scores of each questionnare.

### How to use
**2** directories are required. The first one is the directory wherein the questionnares are contained (the program will prompt you to enter it), and the second is the **./output** directory wherein the converted / renamed files are stored to be read by the program.
